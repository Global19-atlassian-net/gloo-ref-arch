      title: Deploy the new route to Gloo
      description: >
        Now that the vets microservice is deployed, we can route requests to the vets page to this service. For all other requests,
        we can continue to route the request to the monolith. So we update the `petclinic` virtual service
        with this new route.
    renderAsYaml: true
  - curl:
      path: /vets.html
      statusCode: 200
      responseBodySubstring: Boston
      service:
        name: gateway-proxy
        namespace: gloo-system
    docs:
      title: Test the new route
      description: >
        The gateway proxy is still port-forwarded from before. In the browser, navigate to `localhost:8080/vets.html`
        and the vets table should now have a new location column.
      notes: |
        We can also validate with a curl command that a request to that page contains some of the new data.

        `curl -s localhost:8080/vets.html | grep Boston | wc -l`

        This should return 1 - one of the vets in the table now includes a location of Boston.
