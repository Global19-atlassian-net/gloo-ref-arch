# TODO: Rename this back to "workflow.yaml" so it will run in the scripts, once this is fixed:
# https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2534

# Pre-requisites:
# - `valet ensure -f ../../common/workflows/deploy-gloo-enterprise.yaml`

title: Using SNI to route to specific domains with TLS
description: >
  In this workflow, we'll set up a simple application that showcases how Gloo can be used to establish TLS between
  users or clients and the gateway proxy. In this case, SSL is terminated at the proxy and the request is forwarded
  to the upstream service with standard http. SNI will be used to determine the domain in the request.
notes: >
  This workflow assumes you already have a Kubernetes cluster, and you've installed Gloo Enterprise to the gloo-system namespace.
