title: Deploy the Petstore Application
description:
  - First, let's deploy the petstore application.
steps:
  - apply:
      manifest:
        path: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/gloo/v1.2.9/example/petstore/petstore.yaml

        We can run the following commands to deploy the application to Kubernetes. These yaml files contain the Kubernetes deployment and service
        definitions for the application.

        Make sure these pods are running by executing `kubectl get pod` and checking the readiness status for the two petclinic pods. It
        may take a few minutes to download the containers, depending on your connection.
  - apply:
      manifest:
        path: vs-petstore-1.yaml
    title: Create a route in Gloo

      - "Now we can create a gloo virtual service that adds a route to the petstore application. Use `kubectl` to apply the following yaml:"

      RenderAsYaml: "true"

      - To easily copy a yaml snippet into a command, copy it to the clipboard then run `pbcopy | kubectl apply -f -`.
  - curl:
      path: /sample-route-1
      statusCode: 200
      service:
        name: gateway-proxy
        namespace: gloo-system
    title: Test the route

        To test this route, we will leverage glooctl to help identify the URL for the proxy, and issue a curl request to it:

        `curl $(glooctl proxy url)/sample-route-1`

        This should return a 200 and the following json:
        ```
        [{"id":1,"name":"Dog","status":"available"},{"id":2,"name":"Cat","status":"pending"}]
        ```
