  - apply:
      manifest:
        path: upstream.yaml
  # This will temporarily result in an invalid proxy config, since the VS still references a subset
  # However, Gloo will continue to serve the last config until we fix this, which is done next.
  - apply:
      manifest:
        path: vs-1.yaml
