  title: Extending a Monlithic Application with Gloo
  description: >
    In this workflow, we'll set up the petclinic application, which
    consists of a backend server and a database. Once this application is configured in Gloo, we'll look at how you
    can utilize **delegation** to enable teams to manage their own routes while an admin can manage the overall domain.
  notes: >
    This workflow assumes you already have a Kubernetes cluster, and you've installed Gloo Enterprise to the gloo-system namespace.
